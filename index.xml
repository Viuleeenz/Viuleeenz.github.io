      <description>Introduction Because of the massive Ursnif campaigns that hit Italy during the last weeks, I was looking for a lightweight method to quickly extract the last infection stage of all collected samples, in order to start further analysis effectively. Due to this, I wrote a little frida script that performs basic Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) to monitor useful function calls and extracts the Ursnif payload. In this article I am going to briefly discuss this script and the steps needed to start analyzing the resulting binary.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will show how to manually unpack a simple executable that has been packed with WinUPack. However, the goal of this post is to provide a general approach to start reversing code and, in general, packers. Because of that it will be hard to cover all the techniques and strategies that could be applied, but I will try to give the rights hints and the mindset to approach these challenges.</description>

      <description>Who am I? My name is Alessandro Strino and since my adolescence everything related to security has captured my attention, however, starting as OffSec addicted, I moved to malware analysis a few years later, where I have also started to write patches or exploits for fun and no profit. My nickname is a reference to an Italian movie called “Eccezzziunale… veramente” (1985). It was a funny-battlecry from the main characters that became iconic even years later.</description>

      <description>On this page, I will post whitepapers, references of each work or blogpost where I was personally involved. The goal of this page is to share additional information that I wasn’t capable of directly posting on the main page for any reason (e.g., conferences slide, working activities, etc… ).
Nexus: a new Android botnet? At the beginning of January 2023, a new Android banking botnet named Nexus that was promoted by a user on multiple underground hacking forums.</description>
